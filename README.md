# Comparative Analysis of Metrics for Model Drift

**Author:** Vignesh Narayanaswamy  
**Project:** Model Risk Management - Drift Detection Metrics

## Overview

This repository contains a comprehensive analysis comparing **Hellinger Distance** and **Population Stability Index (PSI)** for monitoring model drift in machine learning applications. The analysis provides practical guidance for model owners to make informed decisions regarding metric choice for their specific monitoring needs.

## ðŸ“Š Key Components

### Analysis Files
- **`Drift Metrics.Rmd`** - Main R Markdown analysis file with comprehensive comparison
- **`Drift Metrics.R`** - Standalone R script version of the analysis
- **`Hellinger_vs_PSI.ipynb`** - Jupyter notebook with Python implementation

### Generated Reports
- **`Drift-Metrics.html`** - Interactive HTML report with embedded visualizations
- **`Drift-Metrics.pdf`** - Print-ready PDF version 
- **`Drift-Metrics.docx`** - Editable Word document version

### Visualizations
- **`plot_0.png` to `plot_6.png`** - Generated visualization outputs showing metric comparisons

## ðŸŽ¯ Analysis Scope

### Types of Drift Examined
1. **Mean Shift** - Distribution mean changes from 0 to 3
2. **Standard Deviation Shift** - Standard deviation changes from 1 to 2  
3. **Distributional Shift** - Transition from normal to Poisson distribution
4. **Transitioning Series** - Gradual transition from mean 0 to mean 3
5. **Stationary Series** - Control case with no drift
6. **Skewness Shift** - Changes in distribution shape
7. **Noisy Signal** - High variance scenarios

### Key Findings
- **PSI** shows higher sensitivity to distributional shifts, especially with small proportions
- **Hellinger Distance** provides more robust performance against outliers and noise
- Bin selection significantly impacts both metrics
- PSI tends to be more reactive but may produce false positives

## ðŸ“ˆ Methodology

The analysis uses simulated data with:
- **Training Data:** 1,000 observations from standard normal distributions
- **Live Data:** 3,000 observations with introduced drift at observation 1,000
- **Window Size:** 150 observations for drift detection
- **Step Size:** 1 observation sliding window
- **Binning:** 10, 20, and 50 bins tested for sensitivity analysis

## ðŸŽ¯ Applications
